## RabbitMQ Node.js playground
I maked this repo for playing with RabbitMQ and check developer tutorials.
My improvements with default examples are:
* .env file -  not need to override RabbitMQ connection string and copy-paste it
* typescript -  more readable and clean code with async/await
* eslint with airbnb preset - popular code style preset
* scripts at package.json - run examples from ide in few clicks

# Install.

``` bash
npm install
```

# Usage.
* Fill .env config file
* Run build command: `npm run build`
* Run exist examples.
* Write own, build and execute it.
